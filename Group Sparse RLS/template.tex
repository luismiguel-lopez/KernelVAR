%\section{Introduction}
\begin{myitemize}
\item
\cmt{Modeling}
The most general nonlinear SVARM form can be written as:
  \begin{align}
\label{eq:svar:general}
	y_{j}[t]=\tilde{f}_j(\bby_{-j}[t], \{\bby[t-\ell]\}_{\ell=1}^L)+e_{j}[t],\quad j=1,\ldots, N
\end{align}
where $\bby_{-j}[t]$ denotes all entries of $\bby[t]$ except the $j$-th one, and $\bar{f}_j(.)$ denotes a nonlinear function of its multivariate argument.
\item \cmt{VAR only} We will assume purely VAR models here:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:svar:general}
	y_{j}[t]=\bar{f}_j(\{\bby[t-\ell]\}_{\ell=1}^L)+e_{j}[t],\quad j=1,\ldots, N
\end{align}
\item \cmt{Motivation for additive models}
The sought $\bar{f}$ functions entail $LN$ variables. The 'curse of dimensionality' for large $L$ and/or $N$ motivates introducing a model with simpler functions.
While \cite{shen2016nonlinear} proposes a \emph{generative additive model} where each $\bar{f}_j$ function is separable into a sum of $NP$ nonlinear univariate functions, we propose a model where each $\bar{f}_j$ is separable into a sum of $N$ nonlinear $P$-variate functions.
\item {\cmt{Model}
Our proposed nonlinear VAR model can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    y_{j}[t] = \sum_{i=1}^N f_{ij}(\bby_i[t]) + e_j[t]
\end{equation}
where $\bby_i[t] := \left[y_i[t-1], \ldots, y_i[t-P]\right]$, and $f_{ij}$ belongs to the parametric function space defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{def:parametric}
	\mathcal{H}_i:=\{f_{ij}|f_{ij}(\bby)=\sum_{d=1}^{\infty} \beta_{ij}^d{\varphi}^d(\bby); \beta_{ij}^d, \in \mathbb{R}\}.
\end{equation}
and $\{\varphi^d\}_{d=1}^\infty$ are nonlinear functions that map vectors in $\mathbb{R}^P$ into a feature space. The space $\mathcal{H}_i$ is equivalent to the RKHS defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{def:rkhs}
	\mathcal{H}_i:=\{f_{ij}|f_{ij}(\bby)=\sum_{\tau=1}^{\infty} \alpha_{ij\tau}\kappa_i(\bby, \bby_i[\tau]); \alpha_{ij\tau}\in \mathbb{R},\bby_i[\tau]\in\mathbb{R}^P  \}.
\end{equation}
}
\item \cmt{Criterion}
Our estimation criterion aims at enforcing the sparsity of edges. Since in this case each $f_{ij}$ is associated with each edge in the topology graph, the regularizing penalty is the number of edges that have a nonzero function. For a given node $j$:
\begin{equation}
    \{f^*_{ij}\}_{i=1}^N := \arg\min_{\{f_{ij} \in \mathcal{H}_i\}} \sum_t \left( y_j[t] - \sum_i f_{ij}(\bby_i[t]) \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_i \mathbb{1}\{\exists \bby: f_{ij}(\bby) \neq 0\}
\end{equation}
which equals the function parameterized by
\begin{equation}
    \{\beta_i^{d*}\}_{i=1}^N := \arg\min_{\{\beta_i^d\}} \sum_t \left( y_j[t] - \sum_i \sum_d \beta_i^d \varphi^d(\bby_i[t]) \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_i \mathbb{1}\{\| \boldsymbol{\beta}_i \|_2 \neq 0\}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\beta}_i$ gathers the coefficients $\beta^d$ for $d=1, \ldots, \infty$.
Proceeding similarly to \cite{zaman2017online}, we get around the nonconvexity of this objective by replacing the indicator with its argument, resulting into its group-lasso surrogate. With $\boldsymbol{\phi}(\cdot)$ being a vector function whose image gathers $\phi^d(\cdot)$ for $d=1, \ldots, \infty$, we arrive at:
\begin{equation}
    \{\boldsymbol{\beta}^*_i\}_{i=1}^N := \min_{\{f_{ij} \in \mathcal{H}_i\}} \sum_t \left( y_j[t] - \sum_i \boldsymbol{\beta}_i^\top \boldsymbol\phi(\bby_i[t]) \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_i \| \boldsymbol{\beta}_i \|_2
\end{equation}
\item\cmt{Proposition} $\boldsymbol{\beta}_i = \boldsymbol{\Phi}_i\boldsymbol{\alpha}_i$ for some $\alpha_i$.
